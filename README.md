# Proposal: Same-day Delivery
The development in logistics for home delivery of the online supermarkets now also permits same-day deliveries at acceptable costs. The Swiss example of the Migros- subsidiary LeShop with its customer base in Lausanne illustrates the additional effort compared with a Next-day delivery. The underlying company and process data are based on plausible public information. The delivery addresses are randomly selected from Google-Map.
